# Character Publisher

> Character Publisher is a tool to publish character models and character shaders

## How to install

You will need some files that several Illogic tools need. You can get them via this link :
https://github.com/Illogicstudios/common

You must specify the correct path of the installation folder in the ```template_main.py``` file :
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # TODO specify the right path
    install_dir = 'PATH/TO/template_tool'
    # [...]
```

  </span>

You can publish the model of the character and/or the look of it. You can also publish additional looks by specifying
a look name.
